        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p class="prompt">A 1-2 page summary of the entire project.</p>
        <p>In this project, we implemented a GLSL shader pipeline on the staff Vulkan shader graph for rendering fluid dynamics simulations with mouse or programmatic input. Our pipeline used the grid-based approximation to the Navier-Stokes equations outlined in Jos Stam's landmark paper "Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games."</p>
        <p>We also implemented a variational autoencoder (VAE) and MLP dyanmics model for next-frame prediction using one of our fluid simulations as training data to see if a deep learning-based approach could learn fluid dynamics. However, we found that the VAE and dynamics model together learned a degenerate latent space, so we had to use an end-to-end technique where the VAE also predicted the next frame. Ultimately, the machine learning technique was limited by a lack of training data and compute time, but we believe it has some potential.</p>
